# Deye/Sunsynk Inverters

This repo enables access to Deye Hybrid Inverters & Deye branded inverters like Sunsynk through a Python 3 library. It also provides an Add-On that can be installed in the Home Assistant OS.

This code was developed on a [Sunsynk](https://www.sunsynk.org/) 5.5 kWh inverter.

## Home Assistant Sunsynk Add-On

For the Add-On you require Home Assistant OS and a RS-485 adaptor to connect to your Sunsynk inverter. Sensors are read using the Modbus protocol and sent to a MQTT server. See [deployment options](https://sunsynk.wectrl.net/guide/deployment-options) for examples of tested hardware.
